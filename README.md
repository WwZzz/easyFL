## Introduction
Our FLGo is a strong and reusable experimental platform for research on federated learning (FL) algorithm, which has provided a few easy-to-use modules to hold out for those who want to do various federated learning experiments. 

Welcome to join our FLGo's WeChat group for more technical discussion.

## QuickStart
* Install flgo
```sh
pip install flgo
```
* If the package is not found, please use the command below to update pip
```sh
pip install --upgrade pip
```
* Create Your First Federated Task

*Here we take the classical federated benchmark, Federated MNIST, as the example, where the MNIST dataset is splitted into 100 parts identically and independently.*
```
import flgo
import os

# the target path of the task
task_path = './my_first_task'

# create task configuration
task_config = {'benchmark':{'name': 'flgo.benchmark.mnist_classification'}, 'partitioner':{'name':'IIDPartitioner', 'para':{'num_clients':100}}}

# generate the task if the task doesn't exist
if not os.path.exist(task_path):
    flgo.gen_task(task_config, task_path)
```
*After running the codes above, a federated dataset is successfully created in the task_path. The visualization of the task is stored in **task_path/res.png** as below*

![result](docs/img/getstart_fig1.png)

* Run FedAvg to Train Your Model
```
import flgo.algorithm.fedavg as fedavg
# create fedavg runner on the task
runner = flgo.init(task, fedavg, {'gpu':[0,],'log_file':True, 'num_steps':5})
runner.run()
```

* Show Training Result
  
*The training result is saved as a record under the dictionary of the task **task_path/record**. We use the built-in analyzer to read and show it.*

```
import flgo.experiment.analyzer
# create the analysis plan
analysis_plan = {
    'Selector':{'task': task_path, 'header':['fedavg',], },
    'Painter':{'Curve':[{'args':{'x':'communication_round', 'y':'val_loss'}}]},
    'Table':{'min_value':[{'x':'val_loss'}]},
}

flgo.experiment.analyzer.show(analysis_plan)
```
*We will get a figure as below*

* `algorithm` is to choose the FL algorithm. Options: `fedfv`, `fedavg`, `fedprox`, …

* `model` should be the corresponding model of the dataset. Options: `mlp`, `cnn`, `resnet18.`

Server-side options:

* `sample` decides the way to sample clients in each round. Options: `uniform` means uniformly, `md` means choosing with probability.

* `learning_rate_decay` is the decay rate of the learning rate.

Client-side options:

* `num_epochs` is the number of local training epochs.

* `num_steps` is the number of local updating steps and the default value is -1. If this term is set larger than 0, `num_epochs` is not valid.

* `learning_rate ` is the step size when locally training.

* `batch_size ` is the size of one batch data during local training. `batch_size = full_batch` if `batch_size==-1` and `batch_size=|Di|*batch_size` if `1>batch_size>0`.

* `optimizer` is to choose the optimizer. Options: `SGD`, `Adam`.

* `weight_decay` is to set ratio for weight decay during the local training process.

* `momentum` is the ratio of the momentum item when the optimizer SGD taking each step. 

Real Machine-Dependent options:

* `seed ` is the initial random seed.

* `gpu ` is the id of the GPU device. (e.g. CPU is used without specifying this term. `--gpu 0` will use device GPU 0, and `--gpu 0 1 2 3` will use the specified 4 GPUs when `num_threads`>0. 

* `server_with_cpu ` is set False as default value,..

* `test_batch_size ` is the batch_size used when evaluating models on validation datasets, which is limited by the free space of the used device.

Usage: 1) The hyper-parameter will be set as the default value defined in Server.__init__() if not specifying this term, 2) For algorithms with one or more parameters, use `--algo_para v1 v2 ...` to specify the values for the parameters. The input order depends on the dict `Server.algo_para` defined in `Server.__init__()`.

* `logger` is used to selected the logger that has the same name with this term.

* `log_level` shares the same meaning with the LEVEL in the python's native module logging.

* `log_file` controls whether to store the running-time information into `.log` in `fedtask/taskname/log/`, default value is false.

* `no_log_console` controls whether to show the running time information on the console, and default value is false.

### Fedtask

We define each task as a combination of the federated dataset of a particular distribution and the experimental results on it. The raw dataset is processed into .json file, following LEAF (https://github.com/TalwalkarLab/leaf). The architecture of the data.json file is described as below:  

```
# store the raw data
{
    'store': 'XY'
    'client_names': ['user0', ..., 'user99']
    'user0': {
       'dtrain': {'x': [...], 'y': [...]},
       'dvalid': {'x': [...], 'y': [...]},
     },...,
    'user99': {
       'dtrain': {'x': [...], 'y': [...]},
       'dvalid': {'x': [...], 'y': [...]},
     },
    'dtest': {'x':[...], 'y':[...]}
}
# store the index of data in the original dataset
{
    'store': 'IDX'
    'datasrc':{
        'class_path': 'torchvision.datasets',
        'class_name': dataset_class_name,
        'train_args': {
             'root': "str(raw_data_path)",
             ...
        },
        'test_args': {
             'root': "str(raw_data_path)",
             ...
         }
    }
    'client_names': ['user0', ..., 'user99']
    'user0': {
       'dtrain': [...],
       'dvalid': [...],
     },...,
    'dtest': [...]
}
```

Run the file `./generate_fedtask.py` to get the splited dataset (.json file).

Since the task-specified models are usually orthogonal to the FL algorithms, we don't consider it an important part in this system. And the model and the basic loss function are defined in `./task/dataset_name/model_name.py`. Further details are described in `fedtask/README.md`.

### Algorithm
![image](https://github.com/WwZzz/myfigs/blob/master/fig0.png)
This module is the specific federated learning algorithm implementation. Each method contains two classes: the `Server` and the `Client`. 


#### Server

The whole FL system starts with the `main.py`, which runs `server.run()` after initialization. Then the server repeat the method `iterate()` for `num_rounds` times, which simulates the communication process in FL. In the `iterate()`, the `BaseServer` start with sampling clients by `select()`, and then exchanges model parameters with them by `communicate()`, and finally aggregate the different models into a new one with  `aggregate()`. Therefore, anyone who wants to customize its own method that specifies some operations on the server-side should rewrite the method `iterate()` and particular methods mentioned above.

#### Client

The clients reponse to the server after the server `communicate_with()` them, who first `unpack()` the received package and then train the model with their local dataset by `train()`. After training the model, the clients `pack()` send package (e.g. parameters, loss, gradient,... ) to the server through `reply()`.     


### Experiment

The experiment module contains experiment command generation and scheduling operation, which can help FL researchers more conveniently conduct experiments in the field of federated learning.

### System_simulator

The system_simulator module is used to realize the simulation of heterogeneous systems, and we set multiple states such as network speed and availability to better simulate the system heterogeneity of federated learning parties.

### Utils

Utils is composed of commonly used operations: model-level operation (we convert model layers and parameters to dictionary type and apply it in the whole FL system).
